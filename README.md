<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository contains a mobile application, that very useful for civil engineers ,constructors and other people who are looking for do construction things that they normally needed in their life.

The core component of the project is the prediction of compressive concrete strength from the user inputs in seconds.

<h2> Compressive Concrete Strength Predictor</h2>

<h3>Problem background</h3>

In the field of civil engineering, concrete plays a significant role and it is the most important
construction material. So, people should give more attention to concrete to ensure safety.
Compressive strength is not the only factor that decides the safety of concrete. However, it
affects a larger extent.
In the engineering and construction field knowing the right strength and capacity of the concrete
mixture is a very costly and time-consuming matter. To get the right concrete calculation, the
engineers must wait 28 days for the concrete to fix and furthermore days to get the required
result. Because it needs to be fixed and come to near the peak of compressive strength. The
concrete achieves 65% of their strength at 7 days and 90% at 14 days. However, people should
wait at least 28 days for it to come to near to the peak.
On the other hand, some constructors don't even know the concrete strength to do their
constructions. Since they do not know the right strength of the concrete the construction project
will result in a failure. Furthermore, the mixture can be costly more than the purpose or not
enough strength for the purpose. As an example, when a constructor uses a traditional ingredient
ratio for the first floor of a store building, it will not be strengthened enough. Moving to the other
factor, if the constructor uses the same ratio for a house that is not using more weighted items in
their building, it can be more costly.

<h3>Aim</h3>

The main aim of this application is to provide the users with their desired output which is the 
compressive strength of the concrete by using the added inputs. So many other calculations too 
can be done by this app. to name a few bricks calculator, flooring calculator, steel weight 
calculator and staircase calculator. Not only that, but this application will also help those who 
are interested in the civil engineering field regardless of the region or the gender of the user. 
By using this application users can save their time and increase their work efficiency.

<h2>Data Requirements</h2>

The project is based on machine learning; thus, the team needs some data in datasets to predict 
the strength of the concrete.<br>
Data set - https://www.kaggle.com/prathamtripathi/regression-with-neural-networking
<br>
Among the few available datasets, the team chose, this data set as it is for regression and neural 
networking. It contains a lot of data such as cement, water, fly ash and age by day etc. (8 raw 
materials).
